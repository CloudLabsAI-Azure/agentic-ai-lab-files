# Monitoring AI Agents and Performance Analytics

### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

## Lab Scenario

In this exercise, you will learn how to monitor your AI Agents and analyze their performance using Azure Monitor and Log Analytics. You will access real-time metrics directly from your Azure resources and run basic Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries to gain insights into AI interactions and errors. This integrated approach allows you to quickly identify performance trends, troubleshoot issues, and optimize the performance of your AI solutions.

## Lab Objective

After completing this exercise, you will:

- Monitor Resource Metrics and Analyze Logs

## Task 1: Monitor Resource Metrics and Analyze Logs

In this task, you will explore resource-specific metrics via Azure Monitor and then run KQL queries in your Log Analytics workspace to analyze AI Agent interactions. This unified approach helps you gain comprehensive insights into the performance and health of your AI solutions.
