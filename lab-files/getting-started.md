# Building Intelligent Multi-Agent Systems with Azure AI Services 

### Overall Estimated Duration: 6 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, the focus was on building a comprehensive AI system using Azure's advanced services. The lab began by creating a basic AI Agent powered by Azure OpenAI's GPT-4 and deploying it as an API to demonstrate how AI Agents autonomously process prompts and generate intelligent responses. The next phase extended the agent into a multimodal system by integrating Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, and Computer Vision APIs, enabling the handling of text, voice, and image inputs simultaneously for richer, context-aware interactions. Following that, an AI Orchestration Framework was designed that incorporated a Planning Agent and an Execution Agent to efficiently route and process tasks based on user inputs. Finally, the lab showcased the implementation of a customer service agent that not only responded to queries but also escalated complex or urgent issues to human support via Azure Logic Apps, while integrating a simple feedback mechanism to collect human input for future improvements.

## Objective

Learn how to build and orchestrate AI-driven agents for intelligent customer service using Azure AI Services. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Creating a Basic AI Agent with Azure OpenAI:** Learn to efficiently build and deploy an AI Agent powered by Azure OpenAI's GPT models, streamlining your API development and integration workflows.

- **Enhancing AI Agents with Multi-Modal Capabilities:** Understand multi-modal capabilities by integrating Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, and Computer Vision APIs to create a more interactive, context-aware, and intelligent system.

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration & Context Awareness:** Learn to design an AI orchestration framework by integrating a Planning Agent and an Execution Agent, enabling efficient task routing and processing based on user inputs.

- **Implementing a Customer Service Agent with Escalation Workflow:** Learn to build a customer service agent that intelligently processes customer queries using AI, automatically detects low-confidence or urgent issues to trigger realâ€‘time escalations via Azure Logic Apps, and collects human feedback for continuous improvement.

## Pre-requisites

- **Familiarity with Azure:** Basic knowledge of Azure services and the Azure portal for managing cloud resources.

- **Basic Knowledge of Python:** Familiarity with Python programming and understand the agent workflows.

## Architecture

This architecture integrates various Azure services to create a robust, AI-driven system capable of handling complex tasks, from image analysis using Azure AI Vision to advanced natural language processing with Azure OpenAI. The system ensures efficient workflow management through components like the Planning Agent and Execution Agent, which streamline task execution based on user inputs. Additionally, Azure Logic Apps facilitate escalation flows, ensuring timely support notifications when required. Enhanced by Application Insights for performance monitoring, the architecture delivers a seamless and responsive user experience, making it a comprehensive solution for AI-powered interactions and workflows.
